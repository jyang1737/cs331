1. a) i) Syntactically invalid and therefore meaningless
      ii) Correctly expresses the English sentence
      iii) Is syntactically valid, but does not express the meaning of the English sentence

   b) i) Correctly expresses the English sentence
      ii) Is syntactically valid, but does not express the meaning of the English sentence
      iii) Syntactically invalid and therefore meaningless
      iv) Syntactically invalid and therefore meaningless

2. Let E denote "there exists" and A denote "for all".

   a) Occupation(Emily, surgeon) v Occupation(Emily, lawyer)
   b) E x Occupation(Joe, actor) ^ Occupation(Joe, x) ^ (x != actor)
   c) A x Occupation(x, surgeon) -> Occupation(x, doctor)
   d) !E x Occupation(x, lawyer) ^ Customer(Joe, x)
   e) E x Boss(x, Emily) ^ Occupation(x, lawyer)
   f) E x1 Occupation(x1, lawyer) ^ A x2 Customer(x2, x1) -> Occupation(x2, doctor)
   g) A x1 Occupation(x1, surgeon) -> E x2 Occupation(x2, lawyer) ^ Customer(x1, x2)

3. Let E denote "there exists" and A denote "for all".
   a. A x Cat(x) -> Animal(x)
   b. A x Animal(x) ^ E y Afraid(x, y) -> Run(x, y) v Hide(x, y)
   c. A x A y Cat(x) ^ (Dog(y) v Car(y)) -> Afraid(x, y)
   d. Cat(Louie)
   e. Dog(Jake)
   f. A x Animal(x) ^ E y Hide(x, y) -> !Seen(x)
   g. Seen(Louie)

   Prove Run(Louie, Jake) by contradiction

   Suppose !Run(Louie, Jake)
   - a becomes A x !Cat(x) v Animal(x)
   - b becomes E x !Animal(x) v A y !Afraid(x,y) v Run(x, y) v Hide(x, y)
   - c becomes E x E y !Cat(x) v (!Dog(y) ^ !Car(y)) v Afraid(x, y)
   - f becomes E x !Animal(x) v A y !Hide(x, y) v !Seen(x)
